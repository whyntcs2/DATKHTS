 * Some of this code was written by chatgpt based on my prompt and then
 * fixed by me.
 *
 * This code uses SD cards' SPI mode to allow 1) SD card initialization
 * 2) Single 512 byte block read, and 3) single 512 byte block write.
 *
 * This software uses an "SD card SPI helper" function implemented in
 * hardware on the FPGA.  The helper:
 *   1. Allows SPI signals CS#, CLK, MOSI to be written and
 *   2. MISO to read.  This functionality allows an implementation using
 *      just software bit-banging.
 *   3. But the helper hardware allows an 8-bit SPI transaction to be
 *      done in hardware.  Software just writes the byte to be sent to the
 *      slave to a register, and the transaction happens.  Hardware also
 *      captures whatever the slave sends on MISO.  Software can read a
 *      register to get this response value.
 *
 * The spi_transfer function has two implementations: spi_transfer_b uses
 * bit-banging.  This yields a purely bit-banged implementation. And
 * spi_transfer_h uses the helper hardware.  This yields a hybrid
 * implementation that uses software and just a little bit-banging.  This
 * significantly speeds the performance of block reads and writes, especially
 * when the PicoRV32 core speed to set low.
 *
 * The pins used for SPI (CS, CLK, MISO, MOSI) are determined by the
 * Verilog FPGA image.  They depend on the board's schematic, i.e. the
 * signal connections from the FPGA to the micro SD slot.
 *
 * Do an sd_init before block reads/writes.
 *
 * Extremely old (prior to SDC version 2) micro SD cards may not work. Also,
 * Modern SDUC cards may not work. I don't have one.  I read that SDUC does
 * not support SPI mode.  I have one 128 MByte SD card that fails.  My SD
 * cards with sizes from 4 GBytes to 64 GBytes work.
 *
 * I doubt this code is fully robust.  The SD specification is VERY complex,
 * and some of this code is just from Chat GPT.
